    <h4>
      <b>Your Group</b>
    </h4>
    
    <p> 
      You are in a group with 5 other people. These people have been chosen randomly from the American pool of Prolific.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <b>Your Task</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this study you will complete two tasks.
      Each task has 3 rounds which yields 6 rounds in total. Each of these rounds will take at most <strong>2 minutes.</strong>
    </p>
    <h4>
      <b>Your Payment</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      You will earn a participation payment of {{C.Participation_fee}}$ for completing the study. 
      On top of your participation payment, you can earn a bonus payment of up to {{C.Bonus_fee_max}}$.
      One of the 6 rounds will be chosen randomly to determine your <b>bonus payment.</b>
       This round is called the <strong>Bonus-Relevant Round</strong>.
        The method used to determine the bonus payment depends on the Bonus-Relevant Round.
         Before each round, we will explain how the bonus payment is determined.
          While the participation payment is paid upon completion,
           you will receive your bonus payment within 2 weeks of completing the study.
