    Results

there are 6 tasks. 2 of these are math-memory tasks framed either as memory or as math tasks.
Each participant plays either of these 2 frames and one random task from the remaining 4
At the start of the game a participant is assigned one of the two and one of the 4 randomly. Then the order of these two tasks are randomized and that becomes his treatment.
Then depending on the treatment (e.g. 'Math-memory-memory','SomeTask' or 'SomeTask','Math-memory-math') the participant goes through the task app pages.
